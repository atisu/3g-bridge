The foreign key in cg_job referencing cg_algqueue(grid) is flawed. This
manifests in the following bug:

Consider there are two records in cg_algqueue:
1) [ grid=mygrid, alg=myalg1 ]
2) [ grid=mygrid, alg=myalg2 ]
And a record exists in cg_job referencing 1).

When you try to delete record 2), the foreign key constraint will fail, because
there is a job with grid=mygrid; although, there is no job referencing 2)
itself.

The solution is to remove this foreign key.

First, we must determine its name. The schema.sql doesn't explicitly set its
name, so we have to query it from the database. For this, login to your bridge
database and issue this command:

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE cg_job;

You will see something like this:

CREATE TABLE `cg_job` (
-- Fields will be listed here
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
-- Indexes, keys, etc. here
  CONSTRAINT `cg_job_ibfk_2` FOREIGN KEY (`metajobid`) REFERENCES `cg_job` (`id`),
  CONSTRAINT `cg_job_ibfk_3` FOREIGN KEY (`grid`) REFERENCES `cg_algqueue` (`grid`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

You will have to remove the one referencing cg_algqueue(grid).
In this case, `cg_job_ibfk_3`:

mysql> ALTER TABLE cg_job DROP FOREIGN KEY cg_job_ibfk_3;
