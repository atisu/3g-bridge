Description: Enable running the 3G Bridge in stand-alone mode?
 There are two common ways to run the 3G Bridge: either as a stand-alone
 daemon, or supervised by a BOINC project. Answer yes to this question
 if you want to configure the 3G Bridge as a stand-alone daemon independent
 of BOINC; answer no if you would rather run it under the BOINC project's
 account.
